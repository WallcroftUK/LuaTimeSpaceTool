# LuaTimeSpaceTool

TimeSpace Tool for making Lua scripts for Vanosilla.

## Roadmap

- ✅ Basic UI
- ✅ Basic Functions (Objectives, Maps and Portals Creation, Adding Monsters)
- ☑️ Add Monsters, NPCs with all options (NPCs missing and not all are added)
- ☑️ Adding Actions (Events OnMapJoin, etc., still missing some of them)
- ☑️ Better UI (still needs improvement)
- ☑️ Every Function has its own Window (functions that exist have their own windows)
- ❌ Saving directly to file with name (currently using a TextBox)
- ❌ Usage as TimeSpace/Raid script maker
- ❌ Converting packets to TimeSpace (a challenging task for the entire tool)
- ❌ Clean code (can be further improved)
- ❔ Improved UI/UX: Continuously enhance the user interface and user experience of the tool by refining layouts, adding intuitive controls, and optimizing workflows.
- ❔ Code refactoring and optimization: Regularly review and refactor the codebase to improve its structure, readability, and performance. Consider optimizing resource usage and eliminating any unnecessary dependencies.
- ❔ Localization support: Add support for multiple languages to make the tool accessible to a broader audience.
- ❔ Plugin system: Implement a plugin architecture to allow users to extend the functionality of the tool through custom plugins or modules.
- ❔ Version control integration: Integrate with popular version control systems (such as Git) to provide seamless collaboration and versioning capabilities for project files.
- ❔ Automated build and deployment: Set up automated build and deployment processes to streamline the release and distribution of the tool, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- ❔ User customization options: Provide users with the ability to customize the tool's appearance, themes, and settings according to their preferences.
- ❔ Performance optimizations: Identify and optimize any performance bottlenecks within the tool, ensuring smooth operation even with large-scale projects or complex scripts.
- ❔ Code documentation and examples: Enhance the documentation by providing detailed explanations of the tool's APIs, functionalities, and usage examples to help users understand and utilize the tool effectively.
