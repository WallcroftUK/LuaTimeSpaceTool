# LuaTimeSpaceTool
TimeSpace Tool for making lua script for vanosilla

RoadMap:

✅Basic UI
✅Basic Functions(Objectives, Maps and Portals Creation, Adding Monsters)
❌AddMonsters with all options
❌Adding Actions(Events OnMapJoin and etc)
❌Better UI
❌Every Function have own Window
❌Saving directly to file with name (now in textBox)
❌Usage as TimeSpace/Raid scripts maker 
❌Clean code (as i think it could br better xD)
