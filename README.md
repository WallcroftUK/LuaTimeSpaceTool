# LuaTimeSpaceTool
TimeSpace Tool for making lua script for vanosilla

RoadMap:

- ✅Basic UI
- ✅Basic Functions(Objectives, Maps and Portals Creation, Adding Monsters)
- ☑️AddMonsters,npcs with all options (npcs missing and not all is added)
- ☑️Adding Actions(Events OnMapJoin and etc, dtill missing some of them)
- ☑️Better UI (still needs improve)
- ☑️Every Function have own Window (functions that exist have own windows)
- ❌Saving directly to file with name (now in textBox)
- ❌Usage as TimeSpace/Raid scripts maker 
- ❌Converting packets to timespace (hard thing on this whole tool) 
- ❌Clean code (as i think it could br better xD)
